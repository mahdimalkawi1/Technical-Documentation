                    Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language. It is designed to be
                    portable,
                    meaning that compiled Java code can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
                    installed.

                    Java is widely used for developing desktop applications, mobile applications, web applications,
                    games,
                    and more. It has a strong focus on security and is often used for building enterprise-level
                    software.

                    <h1 id="section2">Key features of Java</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Object-oriented programming: Java is an object-oriented language, which means that
                            everything in
                            Java is an object. Objects have attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods), and can be
                            manipulated through the use of classes.</li>
                        <li>Platform independence: Java code can be compiled into bytecode, which can then be run on any
                            platform that has a JVM installed. This makes Java a popular choice for building
                            cross-platform
                            applications.</li>
                        <li>Automatic memory management: Java has a built-in garbage collector that automatically frees
                            up
                            memory that is no longer being used by the program. This helps to prevent memory leaks and
                            other
                            memory-related issues.</li>
                        <li>Strong typing: Java is a strongly-typed language, which means that variables and expressions
                            must be declared with a specific data type before they can be used.</li>
                        <li>Rich standard library: Java comes with a large standard library that provides a wide range
                            of
                            functionality, including networking, I/O, threading, and more.</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Install the Java Development Kit (JDK) on your computer. The JDK includes the Java Runtime
                            Environment (JRE) as well as the tools needed to compile and run Java code.</li>
                        <li>Set up your development environment. There are a variety of integrated development
                            environments
                            (IDEs) available for Java development, including Eclipse, NetBeans, and IntelliJ IDEA.</li>
                        <li>Learn the basics of Java syntax and programming concepts, such as variables, data types,
                            control
                            structures, classes</li>
                    </ol>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Case sensitivity: Java is case-sensitive, which means that uppercase and lowercase letters
                            are
                            treated differently. For example, "System" and "system" are not the same.</li>
                        <li>Comments: You can add comments in your code to explain what it does. Single-line comments
                            start
                            with two forward slashes (//) and multiline comments start with /* and end with */.</li>
                        <li>Class declaration: To create a class in Java, you need to use the keyword "class" followed
                            by
                            the name of the class. The convention is to use CamelCase for the class name.</li>
                        <li>Main method: The main method is the entry point of a Java program. It is declared as "public
                            static void main(String[] args)".</li>
                        <li>Variables: In Java, you need to declare a variable before you can use it. You can declare a
                            variable using a data type followed by its name.</li>
                        <li>Methods: A method is a block of code that performs a specific task. You can declare a method
                            using the keyword "public" followed by the return type of the method, the name of the
                            method,
                            and any parameters it takes.</li>
                        <li>Control statements: Java provides control statements such as if-else, switch, for, while,
                            and
                            do-while to control the flow of execution of your code.</li>
                    </ol>
